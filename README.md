In today’s highly competitive e-commerce environment, understanding customer behavior is critical for improving retention, personalization, and revenue growth. This project performs large-scale customer segmentation using Apache Spark (PySpark) by applying RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis on real-world e-commerce transaction data.
The project demonstrates how big data analytics can be used to drive data-driven marketing and business strategies. 

🎯 Business Problem

E-commerce companies generate massive volumes of transaction data but often struggle to convert this data into actionable insights. The challenge is to:

-> Identify high-value customers

-> Detect churn-risk customers

-> Segment users based on actual purchasing behavior

-> Enable targeted marketing and retention strategies

-> his project solves this using scalable big data analytics with Apache Spark.

🎯 Objectives

-> Analyze historical transaction data at scale

-> Compute RFM metrics for each customer

-> Perform feature engineering, log transformation, and scaling

-> Apply K-Means clustering for customer segmentation

-> Interpret clusters and derive business strategies

🎯Workflow

-> Data loading and cleaning using PySpark

-> RFM feature engineering

-> Log transformation to handle skewness

-> Feature scaling (Standardization)

-> Finding optimal K using Elbow method

-> K-Means clustering

-> Cluster interpretation and visualization

-> Business strategy recommendations

🎯 Tech Stack

-> Python

-> PySpark (Apache Spark)

-> Pandas, NumPy

-> Matplotlib / Seaborn

-> Scikit-learn

🎯 Methodology & Workflow

-> Data Loading & Cleaning using PySpark

-> Feature Engineering:

-> Recency: Days since last purchase

-> Frequency: Number of purchases

-> Monetary: Total spend

-> Log Transformation to handle skewed distributions

-> Feature Scaling (Standardization)

-> Finding Optimal K using Elbow Method

-> K-Means Clustering

-> Cluster Profiling & Interpretation

-> Business Strategy Recommendations

🎯 Business Impact
